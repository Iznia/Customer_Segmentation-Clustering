# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering

## Objectives

This project aims to evaluate clustering concepts using the K-Means algorithm:

- Understanding clustering concepts with Scikit-Learn.
- Preparing data for use in clustering models.
- Implementing clustering to perform customer segmentation.

## Problem Statement:

A company often faces challenges in effectively targeting and understanding their customers who have varying needs and preferences. Therefore, the company wants to perform customer segmentation based on credit card usage data. The data includes information on credit card usage over the last six months, such as balance, purchases, credit limit, payment behavior, and other details.

To overcome this challenge, the company needs a clustering model that can group customers based on their activities and credit card characteristics.

This data will be used to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means algorithm.

## Objective:

This program aims to develop a clustering model using the K-Means algorithm, including selecting the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Method. The goal is to segment customers based on their activities and credit card characteristics to identify different customer groups with varying behaviors and preferences, allowing the company to provide targeted services and marketing strategies effectively.

## Conclusion:

- The K-Means clustering model was successfully trained to segment customers based on their credit card usage.
- The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method.
- The project demonstrates the practical application of clustering algorithms in customer segmentation, aiding banks in understanding and catering to different customer groups.
